my ender switchwire

The goal of this build is to convert your ender 3 (original version) to a switchwire without changing the design too much.

![overview](https://github.com/UltraWaffles/Voron-Switchwire/blob/master/Mods/UltraWaffles/Images/CAD2.png)

Things to note:
1. This build can work with the ender 3 pro (I have not tested this, as I dont have an ender 3 pro)
2. You only have to cut 1 extrusion by yourself
3. You have to buy a few extrusions (they dont have to be from misumi)
4. This design is made for 2020/2040 extrusions
5. You will be using alot of parts from the original ender 3
6. I have a BoM for all the parts you need, and Ill update it when I finish the CAD model
7. Hammerhead tnuts works just as well as those expensive sliding ones.
8. if you buy shorter M4 flathead screws, you can reduce the height of the bed, thus creating more z height.
